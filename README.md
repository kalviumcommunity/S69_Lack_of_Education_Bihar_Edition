"List of People Who Claim They Skipped School to Become Geniuses (Bihar Edition)"

Project Overview:

This project creates a fun and engaging web application where users can explore and contribute to a humorous list of individuals from Bihar who claim to have become geniuses despite skipping formal education. The goal is to showcase creativity while learning foundational MERN stack development concepts.

Key Features:

User Login System: Users can sign up and log in to view and edit their lists.
Dynamic List: Personalized lists for each user, allowing them to add, edit, or delete entries.
Search Functionality: Users can search for specific entries in their list.
Simple Design: A clean and intuitive UI for easy navigation and interaction.
Tech Stack: Frontend:

React (with basic components and CSS for styling).
Backend:

Node.js and Express.js (for APIs)
MongoDB (for database)
Mongoose (for schema creation and data management)
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication
Why This Project?

This project aligns perfectly with the guidelines by being quirky, engaging, and unique. It simplifies the MERN stack concepts while providing hands-on experience in:

Setting up a full-stack project.
Building a user-authenticated system.
Creating and managing a database with MongoDB and Mongoose.
Designing a basic frontend with React.
By keeping the project simple yet creative, it allows me to focus on core concepts without adding unnecessary complexity.
